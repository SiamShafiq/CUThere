Online school has been rough for everybody but especially for students with disabilities who are struggling with time management and feeling connected. The learning strategists and therapists at university would also benefit from a better way to guide students on scheduling time. We created a dynamic scheduling web application that puts every deadline, exam, office hour and event all on the same calendar. We take in the student's course information and automatically schedules times for classes, tutorials and all TA and instructor office hours. In addition, students can also see events for clubs and societies that they are a part of. 

The calendar has a monthly, weekly and daily view. With more time, we would have liked to add the following features:
- Integrate with BrightSpace API and authenticate students with their student accounts 
- Study Buddy feature by matching users with their free time slots
- Select more societies to view and join
